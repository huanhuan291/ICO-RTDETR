# ICO-RTDETR
China leads in lychee production, with Guangdong driving industry growth. To address short harvest windows, we developed a lychee ripeness dataset and an enhanced ICO-RTDETR model. The improved algorithm boosts precision and recall by 2.1% and 1.9% respectively, delivering accurate, real-time ripeness detection for optimal harvesting.
